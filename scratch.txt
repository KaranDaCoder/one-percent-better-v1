 ---DATES---
 It looks like you're using two different approaches to format the dates, which might be causing some confusion:

formattedDate: You're using toISOString().slice(0, 10) which formats the date in UTC. So this is giving you 2024-12-27 in UTC.

formattedDate1: You're using format() from date-fns, which is formatting the date using local timezone. Hence, it’s giving you 2024-12-26 (since it’s converting the UTC date to your local timezone, in your case, CST, which is UTC-6).

Why the discrepancy?
The formattedDate is being generated in UTC (because of .toISOString()), so it shows the UTC version of the date (2024-12-27).
The formattedDate1 is using the local time (format() from date-fns), and it's converting the UTC date (2024-12-27T00:00:00Z) to your local timezone (CST), showing the previous day (2024-12-26).
The key difference:
toISOString() always returns the date in UTC.
format() from date-fns formats the date based on the local timezone of the machine running the code.
